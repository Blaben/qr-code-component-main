## Overview
This whole challenge is the beginning stage of my greatness into the world of Front End Development. I have been trying to master this skill for quite sometime now but get distructed almost all the time when I try to.
So to build myself up with real challenging stuffs I took up a bld step to join the frontend mentor to learn, unlearn ad relearn.

This is the first Challenge which is the QR Code component Challenge where I demonstrated a bit of my knowledge using HTML and CSS.

### Screenshot

I have added a ascreenshot of the final work to a folder named images

### Links
I added a link to my fiverr account and also to my social media accounts.
have some Ideas we can work on as a team kindly reach out and lets get busy.


## My process
Step 1: I started off with taking a keen look at the images that was provided to me. I made a rough sketch on my notepad outlining how some of the element will be like.

Step 2: went straight to my IDE (VS Code) and started coding things.
first created my index.html file and after working on the skeletal part of the QR Component

I moved on to create the styling in CSS for it.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflows


### What I learned
This is actually my first time creating a mobile version of web page and the feeling was very great. I hope I did everything right?

I really enjoyed writing this code in 
```CSS
@media (max-width: 844px) and (orientation: landscape){
    body{
        width: 850px;
        height: auto;
    }

    .container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-color: #d5e1ef;
    }

    img{
        width: 200px;
        height: auto;
    }

} 

### Continued development
There are really a lot of things I would love to learn. I have a great way ahead of me

### Useful resources
- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU7jJ3NbPdA) - This helped me get more knowledge on responsive designs. I really liked how he explained this in the video.

- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.php?filename=playcss_box-shadow) - w3schools has been one of the tremendouse organization helping a lot if not all on most of the languages we learning today. I wasn't so surprise when (www.google.com) recommended this site for me to best learn and understand about box-shadows. I'd recommend this site to anyone still learning this concept or would love start learning.
